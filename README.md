## Design

**1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?**

Answer. Using wireframe and storyboard helped us to to get clear picture on how the bot should interact and respond for each event in every usecase. Also listing out the flows for each usecase provided a direction on how to move forward with the implementation.


**2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?**

Answer. The most difficult thing was 


**3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?**



## Testing

**1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?**

By creating the mocking infrastructure and implementing integration tests, we were able to find the flaws in the iteraction in early stages and able to corrct our approach to adhere to the proposed bot interactions.

**2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?**

The most difficult thing was to automate testing using selenium as there were cases when the login ID and passwords were incorrectly populated and IDs of few elements in the web page weren't present. We had to try different framework and crack the logic of accessing a certain element in webpage.

**3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?**

I would like to incorporate unittests and automated integration tests in my future projects.

## Process

**1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?**

Scrum-ban provided us a user-friendly graphical interface to track the progress of the tasks and project. We were able to raise flag whenever a certain task was not in the desired bucket/column which would have led to delay in providing necessary deliverables.

**3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?**
