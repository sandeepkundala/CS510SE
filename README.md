# ***HW2-CS510***

This readme file would help the graders to grade the assignment easily and also provide overview on the repo.

The [analysis.js](https://github.ncsu.edu/skundal/HW2-CS510/blob/master/analysis.js) file calculates various complexeties in the javascript file and gives the respective output per function basis and per file.

The following complexeties were computed:
1. ParameterCount
2. Returns
3. AllComparisons
4. String Usage
5. PackageComplexity
6. SimpleCyclomaticComplexity
7. MaxMessageChains

When the complexity analysis is performed on analytics.js by analytics.js
