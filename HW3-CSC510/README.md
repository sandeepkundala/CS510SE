# HW3-CS510: REFLECTION

## Design

**1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?**

Answer. Using wireframe and storyboard helped us to to get clear picture on how the bot should interact and respond for each event in every usecase. Also listing out the flows for each usecase provided a direction on how to move forward with the implementation.


**2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?**

Answer. The most difficult thing was to expand the bot's functionality to help the software engineers as much as possible. I would interact with customers and get the requirement so that a software solution can be developed to satisfy as many customers as possible.

**3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?**

Answer. I would use Architectural Design method which specifies the major components of a system, their responsibilities, properties, interfaces, and the relationships and interactions between them. This provides high level view of the solution. The other design method I would use is detailed design method which specifies the internal elements of all major system components. This provides brief description about the various interactions.

## Testing

**1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?**

By creating the mocking infrastructure and implementing integration tests, we were able to find the flaws in the iteraction in early stages and able to corrct our approach to adhere to the proposed bot interactions.

**2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?**

The most difficult thing was to automate testing using selenium as there were cases when the login ID and passwords were incorrectly populated and IDs of few elements in the web page weren't present. We had to try different framework and crack the logic of accessing a certain element in webpage.

**3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?**

I would like to incorporate unittests and automated integration tests in my future projects. I would also like to incorporate coverage test using unittests to check the code coverage and write further tests depending upon the result.

## Process

**1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?**

Answer. Scrum-ban provided us a user-friendly graphical interface to track the progress of the tasks and project. We were able to raise flag whenever a certain task was not in the desired bucket/column which would have led to delay in providing necessary deliverables.

**2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?**

Answer. The most difficult part was to identify common functions and modularize it so that we have code reusability. In future projects, we would list down all the functions a particular usecase would require and its elements in initial stages of logic coding so that a single code could be used whenever required.

**3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?**

Answer. I would like to try pair programming, agile development and peer review in my future projects as it helped me to solve the issues faced by my peers quickly and save my work regularly so that the team uses the latest code and change their logic in initial stages if necessary.

## Overall

**Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and constrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.**

- With architectural and detailed design, we were able to come up with a design on how the bot should interact. 
- Using scrum methodology, we were able to track each individuals contributions, findings and blockers (if any) and solve it as soon as possible. 
- By starting with developing a test driven environment, and using mocking infrastructure, we were able to finalize the final bot interaction and get insight on how the development of the code should look like.
- Following agile methodology and using kanban board proved to be quite effective in deleivering the project in time.
- Using pair programming and peer review, we were able to communicate our thoughts and optimized the code as much as possible.
